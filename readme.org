* Demiurge

  Attempt of client of Pleroma (It may work with mastodon as well, but
  haven't tried) written in C because i'm criminally insane


** How to use
   Demiurge highly uses the UNIX philosophy
  
   #+begin_src shell
	./demiurge -s "Hello this is a status" -v "unlisted" # Post "Hello
	# this is a status" with the unlisted schope

	./demiurge -F "filename.jpg" -s "ebin maymay :DDD" # Post "ebin
	# maymay" with "filename.jpg" attatched, the file description will be
	# the same as the filename.

	for file in *.jpg; do ./demiurge -F $file -s "sbammin :DD"; done # Posts
	# all jpgs files in different statuses
	cat /etc/passwd | ./demiurge # Posts the output of /etc/passwd
   #+end_src

   demiurge is a tool to make fedi bots using shell scripts rather
   than a client you'd use. For example:

   #+begin_src shell
	export x=$(curl https://some-website.tld)
	./demiurge -s "current weather: $x"
   #+end_src
